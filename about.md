Hello, my name is A SAI RAHUL.

I'm a programmer who loves latest technologies. I love to develop mobile apps, games, softwares and explore more. 

I don't like to limit myself to developing with particular tools or technologies, but I'm experienced with [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html), [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/), [Unity](https://unity3d.com), [Gamesalad](http://gamesalad.com), [Qt](https://www.qt.io), and [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc). I'm pretty devoted to making the world a better place: This means I believe in techonlogy can solve any problem.

I love leveraging build tools and automating every process I can. I enjoy experimenting with new technology and incorporating it into my workflow when appropriate. I <3 open source and find great value in metrics, especially in terms of performance.

I also like painting and music. A lot.
